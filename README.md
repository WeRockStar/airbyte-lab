# Learning EL(T) with Airbyte

Airbyte is an open-source **data integration** platform that helps you replicate your data from different sources to your data warehouse.

As Data Engineers, we often use Airbyte to **extract** data from different sources, and **load** it into any destination of our choice.

Simplied, it is a tool that helps you to **move data from one place to another**.
